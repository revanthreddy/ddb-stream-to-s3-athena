# Run data analytics on data from Amazon DynamoDB using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena



## Prerequisites
For this walkthrough, you should have the following prerequisites set up on your workstation: 
- An AWS account
- [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)
- Python > 3.10.6
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)

## Architecture

## Deployment Instructions

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

### Important resources created by this stack

- Amazon DynamoDB table
- Amazon S3
- AWS Glue resources 
- AWS Lambda function


## Context about Amazon DynamoDB streams
- A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table.
- DynamoDB Streams helps ensure the following:
  - Each stream record appears exactly once in the stream. 
  - For each item that is modified in a DynamoDB table, the stream records appear in the same sequence as the actual modifications to the item.
- Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create triggersâ€”pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams.

## Running this specific application with a specific example
- In this example the lambda that gets triggered when items are "added to dynamodb".

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
 * `cdk destroy`     to delete the stack

Enjoy!
